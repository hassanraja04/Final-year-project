Rationale: Low-carbohydrate diets have been a strategy for weight loss since 1860, and recent studies have shown that low-carbohydrate approaches can be effective for weight loss. 1. Conclusion: No (Calorie for Calorie, Dietary Fat Restriction Results in More Body Fat Loss than Carbohydrate Restriction in People with Obesity, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.08.009> and Nutrient timing revisited: is there a post-exercise anabolic window?, <https://doi.org/10.1201/b16307-5>)\n2. Rationale: While low-carbohydrate diets can be effective for weight loss, other factors such as calorie intake and fat restriction may also play a role in body fat loss. Additionally, the effectiveness of carbohydrate restriction may vary depending on the individual's goals and preferences.",

Conclusion: Yes https://ijeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IJEKS-3-01-011.pdf)\nRationale: The second study shows that parents can safeguard their children's eating habits and keep them away from unhealthy eating by having a strong will and being conscious of its negative consequences. It is also important to teach children about the negative health impacts of fast food, as this can help them avoid it and the problems that come with it. Conclusion: No https://ijeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IJEKS-3-01-011.pdf)\nRationale: The third study shows that junk food habits can contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, and that recent research has highlighted the role of fast food in these conditions. Therefore, it is not advisable to eat whatever junk food one wants, even if one works out regularly.",
